Trump’s deal with Pakistan raises a big question: Does India’s arch-rival really have large oil reserves? Here’s what we know.
Just hours after slapping 25% tariffs on India, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a new energy deal with Pakistan on Wednesday, framing it as a joint project to tap what he called the country’s “massive oil reserves.” Trump’s remarks, shared on Truth Social, included a surprising hint: that Pakistan might one day sell oil to India. The bold claim has reignited debate over Pakistan’s real oil potential — a subject that remains more promise than proven reality.

What did Trump announce about Pakistan?
In a post on his social media platform, Trump said the United States and Pakistan are “in the process of choosing the Oil Company that will lead this Partnership” aimed at developing Pakistan’s oil resources. Framing the deal as a future-looking energy alliance, Trump wrote, “Who knows, maybe they’ll be selling Oil to India some day!” The timing — coming just after economic penalties on India — adds geopolitical weight to the deal.
Pakistan’s current oil reserves: Modest and Overstated?
Despite Trump’s grand language, Pakistan is not currently sitting on confirmed “massive” oil reserves. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) and Worldometer data, Pakistan had 353.5 million barrels of proven oil reserves as of 2016, placing it 52nd globally and accounting for just 0.021% of the world’s total reserves. At current consumption levels (about 556,000 barrels per day), these reserves would cover less than two years of domestic demand without imports or new discoveries.
Daily oil production in Pakistan hovers around 88,000 barrels, far below national consumption, forcing the country to import about 85% of its oil.

Buzz around “massive” reserves in Pakistan
Trump’s comment may be based on recent geological surveys in Pakistan’s Offshore Indus Basin, where seismic data has pointed to potential hydrocarbon formations. A three-year survey, conducted with support from a “friendly country,” identified large underwater structures with oil and gas signatures. Some speculative estimates suggest these could rank among the world’s top four reserves, after Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and Iran.
However, these claims are not yet substantiated. No commercial drilling has confirmed the presence, size, or quality of these resources. Experts warn these are not reserves in the technical sense, as they lack development plans, proven recoverability, or commercial viability.

Pakistan oil reserve: Location, geology, and optimism
The Indus Basin's geological structure, shaped by tectonic activity and rich in mudstone formations, does make it a promising zone for future oil and gas discovery. Seismic interpretation suggests thick source rocks and possible traps, but no successful offshore extraction has occurred in Pakistan so far. Past offshore attempts, such as the Kekra-1 well, failed to yield results.
Nonetheless, the energy ministry and the state-run Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) are hopeful that with foreign investment and advanced exploration, this picture could change.

Pakistan's 2024 offshore oil reserve discovery claim
In early 2024, Pakistan's Ministry of Energy made headlines by announcing the preliminary results of a multi-year offshore seismic survey in the Offshore Indus Basin, claiming the discovery of substantial hydrocarbon potential.
Former Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) member Muhammad Arif and technical experts from state-run companies like OGDCL clarified that these formations cannot yet be classified as "reserves." In the petroleum industry, a resource is only considered a “reserve” when it is discovered, commercially viable, and supported by a full development plan. In this case, no exploratory drilling has been carried out, and no oil or gas has been commercially extracted from these offshore zones.
The 2024 claims are based on 2D and 3D seismic interpretations that point to promising structural traps and thick source rocks in tectonically active zones along the Murray Ridge, where the Indian and Eurasian plates meet. The geological setup includes potential source rocks from the Cretaceous to Miocene age, raising hopes among geologists about future discoveries.

A huge investment challenge
Developing these potential reserves isn’t cheap. Experts estimate it could take $5 billion and 4–5 years just to confirm and begin development of the offshore sites. Infrastructure — pipelines, refineries, ports — would require even more capital. Pakistan’s ongoing economic crisis, including a $126 billion external debt and a high energy import bill of $17.5 billion (2023), complicates matters.
Refining capacity is also limited. Pakistan’s existing refineries handle around 450,000 barrels per day, already strained by domestic needs.

History of oil exploration in Pakistan
Toot Oilfield (Punjab): Discovered in the 1960s with ~60 million barrels in place, though only 12–15% is recoverable.
Lower Sindh Fields: Discovered in the 1980s and now contribute the bulk of Pakistan’s onshore oil production.
